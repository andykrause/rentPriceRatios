ANNOTATION 
Authors set out to test if price to rent (PRR) and price to income ratios (PIR) are persistent over time across 16 OECD countries.  The real goal of the paper is the expansion of their complex co-integration method.  While this doesn’t hold much interest, they do offer a solid literature review on previous studies of price to rent ratios as well as supportive language of the importance of PRR in analyzing housing markets. 
The findings suggest that both PRR and PIR are relatively persistent over time, even when allowing for structural breaks.  Though there are a few countries that are exceptions.  The conclusion seems a bit week and I left with very little gained understanding of the results. 
  
NOTES 
Housing price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios are among the most widely monitored indicators of housing market conditions. 
Ratios of housing prices to income and rents are often used as indicators of overvaluation of housing prices. 
Similarly, households can choose to own or to rent their homes. This choice is affected by the relative levels of prices and rents. High prices relative to rents should push more people into renting, alleviating pressures on housing prices and pushing rents up. 
Nevertheless, deviations of price-to income or price-to-rent ratios from their long-term benchmarks tend to be protracted. 
While price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios may not be very good indicators of the state of the housing market in the short term, they nevertheless seem useful as long term benchmarks. 
This is particularly relevant in housing markets, as structural changes have taken place over the past 30 years in the countries included in the sample. These changes include deregulation of mortgage markets, changes in rental market regulations, property taxation and land-use planning rules, which may generate breaks in the price-to-income and price-to-rent series. For example, if mortgage market deregulation leads to permanently lower mortgage rates, it would be expected to shift the ratios to higher levels permanently. 
Ganoulis and Giuliodori (2011, p. 2671) find that financial liberalization in Europe has resulted in a
‘de-linking’ of short-term house price dynamics from income and argue that ‘the housing market may have
become more similar to a financial asset market, with interest rates and expectations of capital gains playing
a more prominent role’. Canarella et al. (2012) find structural breaks in the rate of capital gain from the
sales of houses in the United States. 
An average or median price index is affected by the share of various types of homes in transactions. To overcome
this problem, mix-adjusted, repeat-sales or hedonic indices are produced in some countries. Coverage varies from most transactions in the country to selected transactions (e.g. certain types of dwelling, homes financed through conventional mortgages) or metropolitan areas. 
Price-to-rent ratios are computed by dividing housing prices by the rent component of the consumer price
index extracted from the OECD Main Economic Indicators data set. 
Hence the price-to-income appears not only nonstationary but also non-mean-reverting. Results are similar when a linear time trend is included. 
In their model, the combination of low interest rates and smaller down-payment requirements pushes up house prices much more than rents and hence leads to higher price-to-rent ratios. Changes in fundamentals, however, explain only about half of the increase in the price-to-rent ratio over the period, suggesting a further role for over-optimistic expectations about house price increases. In sum, the high persistence in price-to-income and price-to-rent ratio},

Annotation 
The authors look to measure over (or under) valuation in Spain, the UK and the USA.  They do so by comparing the actual price to rent ratios against an estimated equilibrium level.  The calculated equilibrium levels remained relatively constant for Spain and the UK over the 1987 to 2003 period, with periods of undervaluation in the late 1990s giving way to overvaluation in the 2000s.  The US shows more variability year to year in the equilibrium values but a slightly less extreme cycle of under and over valuation.  PRRs are the highest in Spain and the lowest in the US as of 2003. Not a particularly helpful article, as much of the estimation in complex and the data is aggregated. 
  
Notes 
Part of that overvaluation—particularly in Spain and the UK—may be attributable to the sluggishness of supply in the presence of large demand shocks in this market and/or the slow adjustment of observed rents. 
Others, however (Case and Shiller, 1988; Clayton, 1996), have directly tested an implicit relation between house prices and rents, using present value models that resemble those used to explain the price to- dividend ratios in the financial literature. 
In addition, the relationship between prices and rents is normally affected by supply restrictions, regulations and contractual practices in the rental market that are not easily captured by standard asset financial models. Moreover, the available empirical studies typically exploit theoretical relationships that imply either a constant or a relatively restrictive specification of the discount factor for future asset payoffs which is not consistent with a meaningful intertemporal asset pricing model. 
Indeed, as for any other asset, equilibrium house prices should be related to future rents through a stochastic discount factor, determined by an agents' intertemporal marginal rate of substitution which, as usual, would depend on their aversion to risk and to fluctuations in their consumption bundle. 
Therefore, the price-to-rent ratio can be approximated by a linear function of the discounted sum of future expected growth rates of rents and the discounted sum of future expected growth of the consumption aggregator. 
It is worth noting that because of the specific nature of this market — building a new house takes a long time — the responses by supply to unexpected demand shocks are very likely to show a high degree of sluggishness. Therefore, prices would tend to overreact in the short run to such shocks. 
Ortalo- Magn{\'{e}} and Rady (2001) also show how house prices may overreact in the short run to income shocks because of the interaction between young credit-constrained households and old non-constrained ones. 
As will be explained later, we compute rental prices from the corresponding domestic CPI shelter components. However, as the average maturity of rental contracts is typically well above one quarter, it will take some time for changes in the equilibrium value of rents to be fully incorporated into the corresponding CPI component. This lag will be all the greater the longer the average maturity of rental contracts. Thus, even if there are no unexpected demand shocks, the price-dividend ratio will converge to its equilibrium — when needed — with some stickiness. 
As usual in the literature rents are computed from the corresponding component of the consumer price index.5 As to house prices, we have used the average price per square metre of all dwellings released by the Spanish Ministerio de Fomento, the average house sale price released by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, and the median house price index released by the OFHEO, for Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, respectively. Both rents and house prices have been deflated by the corresponding domestic CPI indices excluding shelter. It is worth noting that because of the heterogeneity of data sources, variables in levels (including q) are not directly comparable. 
In all three countries, the increases in the last few years have taken house price-to-rent ratios above their equilibrium values. In Spain, the equilibrium ratio has held relatively stable, although it has shown a slight upward trend since the mid-nineties. In addition, part of the increase in real house prices since 1998 may be seen as a return to equilibrium values. As a matter of fact, the fall after the peak in 1991 resulted in a relatively severe overreaction. Nevertheless, in 2001 real house prices already exceeded the estimated equilibrium and in 2003 they showed—in relation to rents —an overvaluation close to 20{\%}, the highest in the available sample. In addition, while in 2001 and 2002 price-to-rent ratios grew on average along the adjusted path, in 2003—during its first two quarters, at least — they grew above such a path. 
  
In the United Kingdom the picture is somehow similar. After some overreaction following the previous peak, the price-to-rent ratio has been above the equilibrium path during the 2000s. The estimated overvaluation is around 30{\%}, on average, in 2003 and there are no signs of a return to equilibrium in this year.16 It is worth noting, too, that the equilibrium ratio is currently fairly similar to that in 1987. 
  
Finally, house prices in relation to rents also seem to be overvalued in USA, albeit to a lesser extent: around 10{\%}. This overvaluation, however, also reaches its peak at the end of the sample. Contrary to Spain and the United Kingdom, overreactions are less marked in this case. The equilibrium ratio exhibits a slight upward trend since the late 1990s as in Spain. 
We have not considered taxes in both the theoretical model and in its empirical application. In principle, the equilibrium relationship (14) should only hold for the after-tax values of prices and rents. The analysis of the impact of national tax or subsidy systems on the transaction and rental value of prices for a representative agent is a complex task that falls outside the scope of this paper. But it is worth noting that, assuming tax changes are essentially unpredictable by economic agents, that feature would only affect the value of the intercept term m′ in Eq. (14). 
According to our results, which, given the approximations implicit in the model and the difficulties of taking into account all possible frictions present in this market, have to be taken with due caution, part of the increase in real house price-to-rent ratios during the late nineties can be seen as a return to equilibrium following some overreaction of house prices after previous peaks.},

Annotation 
Very solid theoretical discussion of both the importance of and the difficulty in creating and interpreting price to rent ratios.  They begin by noting that rental housing and owner-occupied housing do not always match.  In other words, there is a housing ladder that households climb and in most cases rental housing only really matches to the starter homes, not large family homes.  As a result, rent shock only directly impact starter homes.  This effect will slowly, and indirectly, move its way up market, hence the variability we see in PRR.  What this theory also means is that the composite of the housing stock (proportion of starter homes) as well as local demographics can influence PRR ratios and their associated variability. Further, they note that PRR form an important part of inflation calculations via housing equivalence measure.  Poor PRR estimates can propagate into poor inflation estimates. 
The second half of the article creates a theoretical proof to show that segmented housing market in which rental units only match to starter homes will have more PRR variability than a hypothetical case where rental and owner-occupied units are equivalent.     
  
Notes 
While rents are completely passed through to the house price index when rentals represent alternative housing to all forms of owner-occupation, non-constant PR ratios are derived from more realistic housing career structures. In the presence of equity induced up-trading housing markets dominated by family homes are likely to see short-term deviations in PR ratios exceeding those of housing markets dominated by starter homes. 
Leamer (2002) argued for the price–rent (PR) ratio to be for the housing market what the price–dividend ratio is for the stock market. The housing market is regarded as a market where transactions costs, such as cost of information and cost of purchase, create market frictions and lower the opportunity for arbitrage seeking agents to restore market efﬁciency (Hilbers, Hoffmaister, Banerji, {\&}amp; Shi 2008). 
However, markets housing markets carry with them some distinct features when compared to ﬁnancial markets. For instance, by providing shelter, being a vehicle of investments and often serving as mortgage collateral a house serves multiple purposes (Sommervoll, Borgersen, {\&}amp; Wennemo 2010). 
In many housing markets, however, owner-occupied housing does not match the rental market. In contrast, family homes are largely owner-occupied and rental objects are usually smaller and suitable for young adults without children. In short the housing market reﬂects two life cycle trends: an increase in owner-occupation probability over time (until retirement) and an increasing number of square metres per household over time. These time trends allow for a high degree of substitutability between starter homes and rental objects, and less substitutability between family homes and a rental alternative. 
It is natural to assume that the non-constancy of PR ratios observed in real housing markets is largely due to the considerable transaction costs of owner-occupied housing. 
This housing career structure implies that it is only the market segment price on the ﬁrst step of the ladder which is directly affected by changes in rent. Market segment prices further up the ladder are indirectly affected by rent. The indirect effects accompanying up-trading are often equity induced (Kajuth 2010). 
PR ratios are keenly watched and used for a variety of purposes, but two stand out.1 First, the PR ratio is used as an indicator for potential housing market bubbles (Himmelberger, Mayer {\&}amp; Sinai 2005), as well as a predictor for market corrections (Krainer {\&}amp; Wei 2004). The latter because the PR ratio is known to be mean reverting (Gallin 2008). Second, the PR ratio has an indirect impact both on households’ consumption expenditure and their mortgage costs. For most households housing outlays constitute a large budget share. For a tenant, housing consumption is readily deﬁned as rent. Housing consumption for owner-occupied housing is more challenging. One possibility is to deﬁne housing consumption as the rent the home owner would have to pay if she rented her dwelling. This strategy is referred to as “rental equivalence” and is routinely used in many countries in the calculation of the consumer price index. 
In other words, rental equivalence relies on well-behaved PR ratios. 
The up-trading structure implies that renting is an imperfect substitute for owner occupation, as it only represents an alternative to owner-occupation at the ﬁrst step of the housing ladder. 
Basically, expression (14b) states that in any housing market which does not only consist of starter homes, as$\backslash$1, a shock to rent results in short-term deviations in the PR ratio from its long-term equilibrium. Stated differently, PR ratios are not constant. 
If young adults demand starter homes and the elderly demand family homes, economies where the majority of the population is elderly can expect stronger short-term deviations in the PR ratio than economies dominated by young adults and starter homes. 
When ignoring the equity gains of home ownership, rentals and owner-occupied housing provide households with exactly the same possibilities for housing consumption and perfect substitutability might be a reasonable assumption.},

ANNOTATION 
Solid study and the first of its kind to look at the drivers of the rent-price relationship at an individual level.  Findings support theory and suggest that larger and better located homes have lower yields, ceteris paribus.  This also suggests that land leverage plays a role as renters are unwilling to pay full for locational premiums and land values, many of which reflect value from potential highest and best uses and not the actual use.  Bracke brings up a few interesting points about using matched data: 1) you should make sure that it represents the same type of homes as all data; 2) you should be careful in using transactions too close together.  I’d add a third – to make sure that the spatial distribution of them is similar to all homes.  
Interestingly, an earlier version of this study had a comparison with an imputation method, however, this has now been moved to the appendix of the paper.  Good research and approachable read. 

NOTES: 
The aggregate ratio between house prices and rents is often used as an indicator of housing market conditions (Shiller 2007; IMF 2009). 
  
For investors, rent–price ratios are a fundamental component of housing returns. Differences in rent–price ratios across property types are important for portfolio management (Plazzi, Torous and Valkanov 2011). 
  
I document the existence of systematic differences in rent–price ratios across property types within the same urban area: bigger properties and properties located in more expensive neighborhoods have lower rent–price ratios. 
  
The empirical analysis starts with some simple bivariate correlations to show the main stylized facts: rent–price ratios are lower for high-value properties; this pattern is visible also within property categories (apartments, houses); rent–price ratios are inversely correlated to floor areas; rent–price ratios are lower in more expensive postcode districts. 
  
In some regressions, also rent volatility has a negative effect on rent–price ratios, possibly because volatile rents encourage homeownership and therefore raise house prices (Sinai and Souleles 2005). 
  
In the literature, rent–price ratios have been repeatedly measured and studied using aggregate data.

I find that rent-price ratios are lower for bigger and more central units. These stylized facts are consistent with the user cost formula and reflect differences in maintenance costs, vacancy rates, growth expectations and risk premia.

Consistently with theory, I find that additional bedrooms have a positive effect on rent–price ratios.

To remove potential duplicates, every sale or rental contract which refers to the same property and occurs within one month is excluded. This operation has the additional advantage of removing short-term rental contracts, which are usually more expensive than other rentals and targeted to specific markets (e.g., business travelers and tourists)

Finally, to avoid outliers, I trim properties whose price or rent is below the 1st percentile or above the 99th percentile of the price or rent distribution for their transaction year.

Since properties for sale have usually different observed characteristics than properties for rent, they are likely to differ also along unobserved characteristics. Therefore, analyses of the rent–price ratio that combine random samples of sold and rented properties are likely to suffer from omitted variable bias (Smith and Smith 2006). 

I choose six months as the cutoff distance between the sale and the rental. The chosen window around the sale date is asymmetric as I do not select rental contracts signed a few months before a sale.

For instance, Glaeser and Gyourko (2007) use the 2005 American Housing Survey to show that “The median owner occupied unit is nearly double the size of the median rented housing unit,” and that rental units are more likely to be located near the city center.


A possible issue with focusing on matched properties is that the sample of matched properties is not representative of the total stock of housing. 

The results show that rent–price ratios follow a nonlinear pattern, with higher prices corresponding to lower rent–price ratios. This nonlinearity is highlighted also by Garner and Verbrugge (2009), using data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey, and Hill and Syed (2012), using sale and rental data from Sydney.

Regressions in Table 2 show that properties located in better neighborhoods have lower rent–price ratios. This pattern is consistent with the fact that those properties have a higher proportion of their price due to land instead of structure; hence, they have relatively less maintenance and depreciation costs (Hill and Syed 2012).


The price of a property can be decomposed into two components, land and structure (Davis and Heathcote 2007); depreciation and maintenance costs depend on structure. Regressions in Table 2 show that properties located in better neighborhoods have lower rent–price ratios. This pattern is consistent with the fact that those properties have a higher proportion of their price due to land instead of structure; hence, they have relatively less maintenance and depreciation costs (Hill and Syed 2012). Table 2 also shows that properties in apartment blocks have lower rent–price ratios, presumably because maintenance costs are inferior due to economies of scale (Linneman 1985). 

This could indicate that part of the reason why better neighborhoods are associated with lower average rent–price ratios is a lower turnover of tenants. Moreover, when the measure of tenancy duration is inserted together with other potential explanations such as expected appreciation, risk and maintenance costs (in column (5) of Table 4), it loses significance. 
The effect of expected appreciation remains strongly significant even in the specification of column (5), where all variables are included and the sample is reduced to only 385 properties, implying that expected appreciation is one of the most important determinants of residential rent–price ratios. In terms of magnitude of the effect, an expected 100{\%} annual appreciation lowers the rent–price ratio by 1.6–2.5{\%}.

A potential avenue for future research is understanding the consequences of the analysis presented here, based on microdata, for the macrostudies of aggregate price–rent ratios. Inter- national institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and pub- lications, such as The Economist, routinely assess the health of international housing markets by checking the time-series evolution of aggregate price–rent ratios, estimated by dividing nominal house price indices by the rent component of consumer price indices (Girouard et al. 2006). It has been noted that this is an “apples to oranges” comparison because the dwellings in the price index do not match the dwellings in the rent index (McCarthy and Peach 2004, Smith and Smith 2006, Hill 2013). This article shows that even when this problem is solved, i.e., when price and rent data refer to the same units, there might still be a problem of which units form the basis for these comparisons, because different types of properties are associated with different price–rent ratios.},

ANNOTATION 
A deep article, the authors start by spending considerable space explain money illusion, tilt effects and the theoretical relationship between inflation, mortgage rates and house prices.  In short, they are setting out to test if money illusion is real, or in other words if market agents misprice homes due to a failed understanding of the relationship between inflation and house prices (via mortgage payments).  In their results, they do find that nominal interest rates do impact price-rent ratios but real interest rates do not.  This suggests money illusion.  
From a PRR methodology standpoint, there isn’t much new here.  The data is from the UK, which is different than the majority of US studies.  The authors do acknowledge that renting and buying are not perfect substitutes and even not that the types of homes in each are different, however, they blindly accept that a PRR implicitly controls for movements in the underlying service flow.  I would agree, when PRR is measured properly – that is, differences between the types of units that rent and sell are controlled for.  

NOTES:

We decompose the price–rent ratio into a rational component—meant to capture the ‘‘proxy effect’’ and risk premia—and an implied mispricing. We find that inflation and nominal interest rates explain a large share of the time series variation of the mispricing, and that the tilt effect is very unlikely to rationalize this finding. 
There are several potential reasons for this market inefficiency—one of them being money illusion, the inability to properly distinguish changes in nominal values due to changes in real fundamentals from changes merely due to inflation. The housing market is particularly well suited to study money illusion, since frictions, example, short-sale constraints, make it difficult for professional investors to arbitrage possible mispricings away. 
  
Inflation matters and it matters in a particular way. Our analysis shows that a reduction in inflation can generate substantial increases in housing prices in a setting in which agents are prone to money illusion. For example, people who simply base the decision of whether to rent or buy a house on a comparison between monthly rent and monthly payment of a fixed nominal interest rate mortgage suffer from money illusion. They mistakenly assume that real and nominal interest rates move in lockstep. Hence, they wrongly attribute a decrease in inflation to a decline in the real interest rate and consequently underestimate the real cost of future mortgage payments. Therefore, they cause an upward pressure on housing prices when inflation declines. 
  
To identify whether the link between housing price movements and inflation is due to money illusion, we first have to isolate the rational components of price changes that are due to movements in fundamentals, such as land and construction costs, housing quality, property taxes, and demographics (Mankiw and Weil (1989)).1 We do so in two stages. First, we focus on the price–rent ratio to insulate our analysis from fundamental movements that affect housing prices and rents symmetrically. Even though renting and buying a house are not perfect substitutes, the price–rent ratio implicitly controls for movements in the underlying service flow. 
  
Second, in an inflationary environment, the nominal payments on a fixed-payment mortgage are higher by a factor that is roughly proportional to the reciprocal of the nominal interest rate. This causes the real financing cost to shift towards the early periods of the mortgage, therefore causing a potential reduction in housing demand and prices. This is the so-called tilt effect of inflation (see Lessard and Modigliani (1975); Tucker (1975)). 
  
Third, if fixed interest rate mortgages are not portable, individuals who have bought a house and have locked in a low nominal interest rate might be less willing to sell their current house to buy a better one when nominal interest rates are higher. Hence, an increase in inflation that raises the nominal interest rate might depress the price of better-quality residential properties. On the other hand, a reduction in inflation and nominal interest rates would free current home owners from this ‘‘lock-in’’ effect. 
  
Fisher (1928, p. 4) defines money illusion as ‘‘the failure to perceive that the dollar, or any other unit of money, expands or shrinks in value.’’4 Patinkin (1965, p. 22) refers to money illusion as any deviation from decision making in purely real terms: ‘‘An individual will be said to be suffering from such an illusion if his excess-demand functions for commodities do not depend [. . .] solely on relative prices and real wealth. . .’’ Leontief (1936) is more formal in his definition by arguing that there is no money illusion if demand and supply functions are homogeneous of degree zero in all nominal prices. 
  
In a perfect world, money is a veil and only real prices matter. 
  
Genesove and Mayer (2001) document that investors are reluctant to realize nominal losses. 
  
The impact of inflation on wages is more indirect. Inflation increases the nominal profits of the firm, therefore ceteris paribus it will increase nominal wages. Similarly, the reduction in mortgage rates due to a decline in expected future inflation expectations is direct, while the fact that it will also lower future nominal income is indirect. 
  
Lessard andModigliani (1975) and Tucker (1975) show that under nominal fixed payment and fixed interest rate mortgages, inflation shifts the real burden of mortgage payments towards the earlier years of the financing contract. In the presence of borrowing constraints, this limits the size of the mortgages agents can obtain. 
  
In principle, an agent could either buy or rent a house to receive the same service flow. However, renting and buying a house are not perfect substitutes since households might derive extra utility from owning a house (e.g., ability to customize the interior, pride of ownership). Moreover, properties for rent might on average be different from properties for sale. 
  
Compared to the price-income ratio, the price–rent ratio has the advantage of being less likely to increase dramatically due to changes in fundamentals (e.g., in demography or property taxes). 
  
From the predictive regression of the price–rent ratio on 1/rt—as suggested by Equation (1) —we learn that this variable is not significant nor has any forecasting power for the future price–rent ratio, reinforcing the conjecture that housing prices do not tend to respond to changes in the real interest rate. However, the reciprocal of the nominal interest rate, 1/it , is highly statistically significant and has a positive sign implying that the price–rent ratio tends to comove with the valuation of agents prone to money illusion. Moreover, this regressor is able to explain about 9{\%} of the time variation in the price–rent ratio. 
  
We find that (i) lagged inflation and nominal interest rates explain 6{\%} to 10{\%} of the time series variation of the changes in the price–rent ratio, (ii) these regressors are statistically significant at levels between 1{\%} and 5{\%}, (iii) the estimated signs are consistent with money illusion, and (iv) the real interest rate does not have any predictive power for changes in the price–rent ratio. 
  
Our first-cut analysis in Section 2.1 showed that nominal terms covary with price–rent ratio rather than real terms. But this link might be due to rational channels, frictions, or money illusion. 
  
Two potential explanations of the link between the price–rent ratio and inflation naturally arise. First, inflation might make the economy riskier, or agents more risk averse, thereby increasing risk premia and driving down real estate prices. Second, current high inflation might be disruptive for the economy and/or inflation might proxy for future downturns, thereby depressing current housing value. We do not find supportive evidence for the first hypothesis, while the evidence in favor of the second hypothesis does not seem to be robust in the housing market context.},

Specifically, we start with the definition of the one-period return to housing. It can be shown that this definition implies that the ratio of housing rents to house prices, the ‘‘rent–price ratio,” must be equal to the present discounted value of expected future housing service flows and the expected future returns to housing assets. $\backslash$$\backslash$
$\backslash$$\backslash$
This model is known in the finance literature as the dynamic version of the Gordon growth model (Campbell and Shiller, 1988a,b). The approach is equivalent to assuming that house prices are the discounted sum of housing rents, where the growth rate of housing rents and required return to housing can vary over time. It is precisely this variation over time in expected required returns and expected growth rate of housing rents that yields changes in relative house prices, enabling us to study the factors responsible for time-series changes to housing valuations.$\backslash$$\backslash$
$\backslash$$\backslash$
Any trends in the implicit rental price of owner-occupied housing that are not captured by trends in the explicit rental price of tenant-occupied housing will affect our analysis and conclusions, and our results should be interpreted with this caveat in mind. Data on the growth rate of rents paid by renters are reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for 23 separate metropolitan markets, the four Census regions, and the nation.6 Note that the region-level rent indexes are not simple averages of the component metropolitan markets in our analysis: the BLS collects rent data for over 80 metro markets and uses those data for regional and national estimates, but only publishes metro-area indexes for selected markets. Because the BLS data are reported at a semi-annual frequency for several markets, we conduct all our analysis at this frequency. Where needed, we average quarterly readings to convert to a semi-annual frequency.$\backslash$$\backslash$
$\backslash$$\backslash$
Using a VAR approach, we show that real interest rates, housing premia, and rent growth all exhibit substantial predictable variation. Each of these three components of the rent–price ratio makes a significant contribution to its variation. The resulting variance decompositions that we perform reveal some important characteristics of housing market behavior.$\backslash$$\backslash$
$\backslash$$\backslash$
First, we find that housing premia exhibit significant variation. Over the 1975–1996 period, variation in risk premia was the principal source of variation of rent–price ratios at the national level. Variation in premia is an important source of rent–price ratio variation at the regional and metropolitan market level as well. Even during the boom period, 1997–2007, our approach (which residually attributes most of variation in rent price ratios to changes to expected future rent growth) indicates that variation in premia accounts for about 20$\backslash${\%} of variation in all of our markets.}},

Annotation 
The authors set out to see if rent to price ratios have any predicitive power in explaining future housing price appreciation rates.  As theory would suggests, areas with high (relative) rent to price ratios should see greater future appreciation that those areas without.  The results of this study do support this contention when looking at 64 metro regions in the US over the 1950 to 1980 period (decadally).  
The method in this study isn't much help for advancing PRR, but it is an old study with very aggregated data.  The authors do note issues with constant quality comparisons between houses for sale and those for rent.  They attempt to correct for this in their models with an instrumental variable approach.  In addition to the findings, this paper does offer an important theoretic discussion of relationship to 1/PRR and appeciation and returns. 
Notes 
To derive empirical predictions from this proposition, we borrow from the stock dividend literature and show that if this proposition is true, then rent/price ratios should predict future appreciation rates. This empirical prediction is the basis of our tests. 
  
However, owing to high transactions and information costs, asymmetric information, and differences in the quality of rental versus owner-occupied housing, appreciation rates and rent/price ratios calculated from census data will be measured with considerable error. 
  
We interpret this finding as evidence that observed rent/price ratios contain a disequilibrium component, indicating some mean reversion in the relative prices of rental versus owner-occupied housing. 
  
Because expected total returns are the sum of the dividend or rent yield and an expected appreciation rate, urban areas where rent/price ratios are high should have lower expected appreciation. 
  
Therefore, if information about existing rent ratios has been efficiently impounded into housing prices, then the rent/price ratio should have significant predictive power for future capital gains. 
  
Several problems arise from using observed changes. First, the observed rents are not on the same houses as the observed prices. Because owned and rental units tend to be of different quality, there is measurement error in the 
data on the rent/price ratio. 
Second, although arbitrage is normally assumed to keep prices close to the long-run equilibrium, all assets trade within a band determined by transaction and information costs. In real estate markets these costs are large relative to securities markets, so real estate trades occur at prices within a wide price band. 
  
Therefore, regressing the observed appreciation rate on the observed beginning of period rent/price ratio will result in positively biased coefficient estimates. 
  
To mitigate the measurement error problems, we use an instrumental variables or two-stage least squares technique. In the first stage, we regress the observed rent/price ratio on a set of variables suggested by Capozza and Helsley (1990) and Capozza and Sick (1994) in their investigations of urban growth with uncertainty. 7 These variables include income, income growth, population, population growth rate, property tax rate, developable areas in the city, and construction costs. We also add variables specifically designed to help accommodate cross-sectional differences in quality, including utility cost rates and the number of baths, as well as lagged growth rates and population. 
  
Thus, current rent/price ratios appear to have the power to predict subsequent capital appreciation. 
  
First, if homeowners have a strong preference for capital gains, perhaps due to asymmetric tax treatment, then a 1{\%} decrease in rent yield will result in a less than 1{\%} increase in required capital gains.lation and income. The results are not sensitive to alternative specifications. 
  
However, we argue that observed rent/price ratios are comprised of two components: an equilibrium component that varies across SMAs due to cross-sectional differences in the relative quality of rental and owneroccupied housing, and a disequilibrium component. We identify these two components in a first-stage regression and then use this decomposition to estimate the relationship between rent/price ratios and subsequent rates of appreciation. 
  
The quality-adjusted or equilibrium component of the rent/price ratio is a valuable predictor of subsequent house price movements. Furthermore, consistent with rational expectations, each percentage increase in the annual rental flow is offset by a reduction in annual appreciation by 0.6-0.85{\%}. Because the equilibrium component of the rent/price ratio ranges from 4{\%} to 8{\%}, cities with the lowest rent/price ratios can be expected to appreciate 27-40{\%} more per decade than those with the highest rent/price ratios.},

Results show that ratios as of the mid 1990s were astronommically high compared to the calculated rational ratio.

Notes 
Chinese urban housing has been predominately a merit good, not a commodity. 
  
The successful development of the Chinese urban housing market thus hinges on a rational price±rent ratio and affordable housing. 
  
These nominal rents are a direct result of the low income and low expenditures (di shouru, di 
xiaofei) policy instituted by the government at the establishment of the socialist economy. Under this system, the government collected an implicit income tax from workers through low wages, then provide d heavy subsidies back to them in the forms of housing, food, medical care, etc. 
  
As the costs of owning relative to the cost of renting can be approximated by the median house value and the median gross rent; the ratio of the two costs can be represented by the ratio of these two averages. 
  
As shown in the equation, the cost of ownership positively correlates with the costs of: mortgage payment (or the loss of investment income when the house is paid in full, which is more typical in China); depreciation (d*P); maintenance (m1*P); management (m2*P); and real estate taxesÐ but relates negatively to expected appreciation (a *P), suggesting that expected capital gains lower the relative cost of owning. 
  
He suffers from being unable to snatch capital gains that accrue only to an owner, and this 
is why the expected housing appreciation adds to the cost of renting by a *P if we move this term to the left. 
  
Such a ratio is a negative function of five factors. First, it increases with a decline in the interest rate because the lower the interest rate, the lower the rate that discounts the ¯ ow of imputed future rental income and the lower the opportunity cost of investing money in housing. Secondly, the ratio rises with the decrease in the depreciation rate because a better-built house with a longer life has a higher demand price. Thirdly, when it costs less to maintain the house (or the lower is m1), the more valuable is the house, and the higher will be P. Fourthly, the more 
costly it is to handle mortgage and property tax payments and/or to collect rents, the lower will be the demand price for the house. 
  
Fifthly, the demand price for housing decreases when real estate taxes (e.g. property taxes) are high. Finally, the ratio correlates positively with the expected rate of appreciation or capital gains. When this rate, a , increases, houses become more attractive to buyers and people will buy at higher prices with the same imputed rent or at same prices with a lower imputed rent. 
  
The distorted price-rent ratios are a direct consequence of the low wage-low rent policy in the past decades.},

We show that the rent-price ratio ranged between 5 and 5.5 percent between 1960 and 1995, but rapidly declined after 1995. By year-end 2006, the rent-price ratio reached a historic low of 3.5 percent.

ANNOTATION: 
In this simple piece Davis and co-author discuss the creation of a historical rent-price ratio (RPR) measure.  After doing so, a brief conclusion notes that the RPR remained steady from 1960 to the mid-1990s, however it has fallen significantly since then.  This relates to Shiller’s concerns about the (actual) bubble that did occur. 
In terms of calculations, the authors create a quarterly RPR index at the national level from 1960 to 2006.  For the decennial years, they utilize Census of Housing actual rent and housing value figures.  They first build a rent model and use that to impute rent for the owner occupied dwellings.  They then compute an RPR for each of these observations.  Rents are netted by subtracting an estimate of utilities.  These are then average and compared to create an RPR for the year.  The inter-censal years estimates are interpolated with the BLS rent index and the Freddie Mac housing index.  
NOTES: 
Yet knowledge of the rent-price ratio could be key to understanding the behavior of the total returns to housing. There are two related reasons for this. First, the total return to any asset is the sum of the dividend yield and the capital gain, and the dividend yield to housing is the rent-price ratio. 
Thus, knowledge of the dividend yield for housing—the rent-price ratio—is crucial to (a) understanding the true historical return to housing and (b) estimating market participants’ expectations about the future capital gains to housing. 
Using the same logic as in the examples above, the dramatic decline in the 1995–2006 period may have occurred either because the discount rate on housing dividends declined, or because expected future capital gains on housing increased, or both. 
Using the accounting framework outlined by Campbell and Shiller (1988), Campbell et al. (2007) show that almost all of the decline in the rent-price ratio is attributable to either a steep decline in the risk premium paid to housing over and above a 10-year Treasury bond, or an increase in the expected rate of growth of house prices, or some combination of these two factors. The unprecedented and steep decline in the rent-price ratio, and associated change in the risk premium paid to housing and/or growth expectations of house prices, led Shiller (2005) to conclude that the United States experienced a sizeable housing bubble over the 1995–2005 period.},

Annotation 
Interesting international study on the ability of rent/price ratio to predict future rents or returns.  The theoretical discussion of the likely relationship between these factors is solid.  The analysis is sufficient, especially the work on the differences between real and nominal values.   In terms of PRR calculations it offers a simple median method (using indexes) as is common.  The wide variety of countries does offer something novel.  The findings show that most countries follow the expected relationship, increase in RPR equates to an increase in future returns.  Some do not. 
Notes 
First, there is a highly unstable predictive pattern in rent growth across countries and time periods. Second, the predictive patterns are highly dependent on whether housing returns and rents are measured in nominal or real terms. These results are difficult to reconcile with fully rational expectations. 
  
Standard textbook models of price determination in housing markets imply that rents are a fundamental determinant of housing value, similar to the role of dividends in determining equity valuations in stock markets, and the rent-price ratio (sometimes denoted the ‘cap rate’) summarizes market expectations of future housing returns and/or rent growth in the same way as the dividend price ratio summarizes expectations of future stock returns and/or dividend growth. 
  
Either a speculative bubble, changing expectations of future returns (e.g. due to changing risk premia), or changing expectations of future fundamentals. The empirical evidence cited above points to the second of these causes as the most important, although Shiller (2005) argues that an irrational bubble was the main driver, while Himmelberg et al. (2005) on the other hand argue that the price increases were caused by ‘strong’ fundamentals. 
  
Based on the ‘dynamic Gordon growth model’ (Campbell and Shiller, 1988), which has been used in several recent housing studies (see the references in Section 2), and using the restricted vector-autoregressive (VAR) framework from Cochrane (2008), we test whether the log rent-price ratio significantly predicts future log returns and/or rent growth. 
  
The main findings of our analysis are as follows. For the vast majority of countries the rent-price ratio significantly predicts returns in the ‘right’ direction, i.e. an increase (decrease) in the ratio signals a future increase (decrease) in returns. This is in accordance with the standard notion of time varying expected returns and risk-premia. 
  
Thus, given forward-looking expectations and no bubbles, there is a sound theoretical argument as to why the rent-price ratio should predict future returns and/or changes in rent. The economic intuition behind (2) is that, holding expected returns constant, an increase in expected future rent leads to an increase in today's house price and thereby to a decrease in the rent-price ratio. Similarly, holding expected rent growth constant, an increase in expected future returns must imply a lower price today and thereby an increase in the rent-price ratio. 
  
For the remaining countries the t-statistic is above 2 which implies that returns on the housing market are significantly predictable by the rent-price ratio on a 5{\%} level. For many countries the R2 is also remarkably high. For example, in Spain and Ireland the R2 is 49.8{\%} and 40.0{\%}, respectively. 
  
In conclusion we find that the degree of return and rent growth predictability by the rent-price ratio can be very different depending on the use of nominal or real data, and that the explanation for this discrepancy is inflation predictability by the rent-price ratio.},

ANNOTATION 
The authors set out to test the common wisdom that buying a house is always better than renting.  What they find is that, actually, over the past 30 to 40 years that renting was actually the wiser economic decision, so long as homeowners directly invested any savings from renting.  The authors use the PRR from Davis et al 2008 to help assess the economic virtues of renting vs buyer. 
As they don't construct their own metric, this study is of limited value from a methods point of view.  It does, however, provide a solid literature review on the issues, noting two especially important points: 1) Moving from renting to owning is almost exclusively a one way path; and 2) comps will tell you relative value, but not absolute.  
  
NOTES 
In particular, financial arguments concerning the relationships between the rent-to-price ratio and property appreciation and the rent-to-price ratio and price volatility are combined with the national imperative to buy to
investigate the rent versus buy decision. 
Two major findings evolve from the analysis. First, ex ante and ex post, individuals were better off in economic terms, on average, to have rented for most of the years in the study period. This first result is strongly dependent upon fiscally disciplined individuals that, without fail, reinvest any residual savings from renting. Second, fundamental drivers now appear to be in place that favor homeownership over renting in the near-term future. 
Rather than constantly evaluating whether owning is preferable to renting, the movement from renting to owning is almost exclusively a one-way path that is correlated with levels of income and wealth (Xiao and Liu 2007). 
In other words, the “comps” approach can only help us decide whether to buy property A or property B, but it is useless in making a buy versus rent decision due to its inability to provide an estimate of value in absolute terms. Shiller (2007, 2008) argues that failure to value housing based on its fundamentals combined with future home prices optimism lead to a feedback-speculative bubble where home prices are set well above their intrinsic value. 
The rent-to-price ratio is also a common gauge in valuing residential real estate overtime (Martin 2008). 
Because home prices only represent a portion of the total cost of home ownership, most of the rent-to-price volatility is embedded in the volatility of home prices rather than that of rents (Verbrugge 2006, Kim 2008). This limits the
ability of the rent-to-price ratio to serve as a single reliable home valuation measure. 
Verbrugge (2006) tests the standard Jorgensonian (frictionless) theory, according to which home user costs equal rents, finding a substantial divergence between the two that persists for long periods of time. 
As a result, potential homebuyers mostly ignore renting in favor of buying and do not consider the true cost of ownership. Such behavior is likely to cause home prices to rise above their fundamental rent value, which in turn makes renting highly preferable in economics terms. 
To identify rent-to-price ratios, this article relies on a data set constructed by Davis, Lehnert and Martin (2008) for the stock of owner-occupied housing. 
Column (2) reports the required appreciation rate, in annual percentage terms, which makes potential homeowners indifferent between buying and renting. For the United States as a whole, the required appreciation rate is currently 3.25{\%}. This implies that the average potential homebuyer in the United States should require appreciation of more than 3.25{\%} annually during the next eight years in order to justify buying rather than renting a home. If the potential homebuyer believes that real estate appreciation in the United States is likely to be less than 3.25{\%} annually, renting is preferable to buying. As of the second half of 2009, the required appreciation rate ranges from a low of 1.71{\%} for Detroit to a high of 5.30{\%} for Honolulu. Among the regions, the required appreciation rate for the West is the highest with 4.14{\%}, and it is lowest for the South at only 2.97{\%}. 
It is important to note that while the model used to derive the required appreciation rates over time includes some constants, five variables are, however, changing with time: rent-to-price ratio, mortgage interest rate, expected return
on the investment portfolio, rate of rent growth and growth rate of homeowner expenses.

Annotation 
In this discussion paper the authors – of the Reserve Bank of Australia – show that, via their metric, housing in Australia is not overvalued.  They do so by comparing rental yields (and rental costs) to the user costs of housing.  As these numbers are very close, they suggest that there is little financial difference between owning and renting.  They do note, however, that there may be significant non-financial differences between households that make one choice more favourable than another.   These results are robust to various sensitivity tests of future discounting.  As the user cost method is highly dependent on future appreciation assumptions, there is obvious a high level of uncertainty in these estimates.  
This work has been contested in the public media as the authors ignore issues of price to income relationships (though they are very clear on why they do so in the paper).  They also make an assumption that the difference between prices and rents are independent, which is not true as many of the same factors such as labor and material costs influence both of them.  In sum, what this paper is really ask is if renting is better than owning (and in what situations) rather than if housing is overvalued.    
Notes 
First, we focus on conditions in Australia. Second, we use a new dataset that matches prices with rents for a large representative sample of properties. In contrast, most previous comparisons of the cost of owning and renting have used different and inconsistent data sources for house prices and rents. Because houses that are bought differ from those that are rented, in both observable and unobservable ways, it has been difficult to discern whether differences in cost reflect differences in quality. Accordingly, researchers could only compare changes in prices with changes in rents. Even then, they have needed to assume that quality changes are controlled for similarly in the two series. This assumption becomes increasingly doubtful over longer periods. 
To summarise our results, we find that assessments of house prices are sensitive to assumptions about expected capital gains. If real house prices were to continue to grow at the average rate of the past six decades, then buying a house now would be about as costly as renting. To put this another way, the expectations of future capital gains implied by current house prices are in line with historical norms. That allays some concerns about a housing ‘bubble’. 
But these comparisons are beyond the scope of this paper. Put slightly differently, we examine whether house prices are in line with rents. A broader study could examine whether housing prices and rents are jointly over or undervalued relative to other consumer prices. 
Second, we only examine purchases by owner-occupiers, who account for two-thirds of all dwellings. Investors make similar decisions, but these are complicated by taxes. 
Being told that a house is expensive relative to incomes does not tell you whether the purchase is sensible. For that decision you need to know the cost of the alternative. 
An upward-trending ratio is to be expected when land is in limited supply. Then, as income (and hence the demand for housing) grows, both prices and rents increase. Because demand for housing is price-inelastic, prices need to rise faster than incomes to keep demand in line with supply. 
Another popular approach is to compare price-to-rent ratios to their long-term averages. 
The price-to-rent ratio is not stationary, but moves with these variables. Indeed, the price-to-rent ratio in Australia has increased over the past few decades, reflecting a decline in the user cost. Unless the user cost is expected to revert to its average, neither will the price-to-rent ratio. 
 Owner-occupied houses tend to be larger and more expensive than rental dwellings. So a comparison of average prices with average rents reflects quality differences. This problem can be addressed by focusing on changes. Or, more commonly, the focus is on deviations from the average, on the questionable assumption that houses are fairly valued on average. 
 Our work differs in that we measure rents and prices for the same properties. This enables us to hold housing quality constant and hence assess the level of overvaluation. Several studies have also attempted to do this in the United States, including Smith and Smith (2006), Davis, Lehnert and Martin (2008), Campbell et al (2009) and Garner and Verbrugge (2009). 
  
The annual cost of owning a home can be written as Cost (in dollars) = P(r + c + s + d −ð ), (1) where P represents the price of the property; r the real interest rate (a composite of the mortgage rate and the opportunity cost of owner’s equity); c represents other running costs, such as repairs, rates and insurance, as a proportion of the price; s represents buying and selling costs (stamp duty, agent commission, etc.), also as a proportion of the price, averaged over the period of home-ownership; d is the physical depreciation rate; and ð is the expected real appreciation rate of the property on a constant-quality basis (that is, excluding the effects of improvements and depreciation). In contrast to other countries, the Australian income tax code does not directly affect the cost of housing for owner-occupiers. 
As a simplification, if the property has been sold within the previous ten years, the sale price is brought up-to-date by multiplying it by the change in a hedonic price index since the time of the sale. In the absence of a recent sale, the price is imputed by detailed hedonic regressions. 
 Our estimates of running costs are based on expenses that landlords claim against rental income on their tax returns. The largest of these are council rates, repairs, and expenditure on furnishings and equipment. We exclude expenses that would be paid by investors but not owner-occupiers, such as property agent fees and land tax. 
 The value of these nonfinancial considerations can be assessed by the amount that households are prepared to pay for them, represented by the wedge between the rental yield and the user cost. The small size of this wedge, when averaged over time, suggests that the average value of these non-financial considerations has been small. 
 Third, as can be seen in the middle panel, the rental yield trends down over our sample. Hence, studies that compare recent levels of this ratio or its inverse to its historic mean, such The Economist (2013) or the OECD (2013), will persistently find large ‘overvaluation’. This downtrend in rental yields has been matched by similar downtrends in the user cost (middle panel), in turn largely reflecting a downtrend in real mortgage rates (top panel). Measures of overvaluation (bottom panel) are trendless. 
 This exceeded other components of the user cost, so the total user cost was negative, as shown in the middle panel. Interestingly, Garner and Verbrugge (2009, Figure 7) also estimate negative user costs in the United States at this time, reflecting high expected capital appreciation. Taken at face value, these estimates imply that, given the large capital appreciation, people could expect to live in their house for free. Whether such an expectation is plausible is controversial: in standard models it would imply demand becomes infinite. 
 We are sceptical of estimates of overvaluation at a point in time where expectations are proxied by a short rolling average. This approach leads to conclusions that housing is undervalued at the peak of the bubble. Nevertheless, this assumption is standard in the literature. 
 A difference in the cost of renting and owning – and hence a difference between the break-even rate and expectations – can be sustained indefinitely if there are nonfinancial benefits or costs of owning relative to renting. 
These changes are small and their net effect is even smaller. The expected increase in real rents and the discounting of selling costs are partially offset by the discounting of capital gains. The net result is to make home ownership slightly more attractive, relative to renting. 
 The main reason is that studies of equity valuation typically assume that higher growth in earnings feeds back into greater appreciation whereas we do not. 
 Home ownership is more attractive the longer a house is owned, because transactions costs are amortised over a longer period. However, because housing tenure affects the user cost non-linearly, the size of this effect is not obvious. 
 With historical average real house price expectations of 2.4 per cent, represented by the green dashed line in Figure 7, buying is less expensive than renting for anyone expecting to stay in their house for more than eight years. 
 Consistent with conventional wisdom, households expecting to move again in a few years’ time are better off renting, unless they believe they can sell the property for an unusually large capital gain. 
 Fourth, the implications for lending standards might be worth considering. When financial institutions set loan-to-value limits, should the denominator be the fundamental value or the market value? 
 Since 2010, the RBA has commissioned RP Data-Rismark, a private property data provider, to compile estimates of the average ratio of rents to prices of matched properties. These estimates have been regularly published by the RBA in its Statement on Monetary Policy and other Bank publications. The numerical data are confidential and available for purchase from RP Data. 
 The numerator in each of these estimates equals the sum of annual advertised rent on all properties listed for rent on major real estate websites. These websites cover almost all properties available for rent. The denominator is the sum of imputed prices on those same properties. 
 The first is the most recent sale price of the property, multiplied by the change in a hedonic price index over the period since that sale. This component receives a weight that declines as the period since the sale increases, reaching zero at ten years. The second component is the prediction of hedonic regressions – that is, the average price at that time for a unit or house in that postcode with the same floor size, bedrooms, bathrooms and other observable characteristics. Sales on nearby properties are given a higher weight in these calculations. The RP databases (like the APM data used by Hill and Syed (2012)) are unusual in that they match administrative data on sale prices with detailed property characteristics from internet advertisements for a near-universal sample. 
 Furthermore, using advertised properties means that we weight rental yields by turnover and time on market. This may be unrepresentative of the rental stock in general if properties with unusually high rents are listed for longer or have higher turnover. 
 So the rental yield constructed from REIA estimates is lower than the rental yield from matched properties. 
In total, we assume that buying and selling costs now add about 7¼ per cent to the cost of a property. We assume that they added slightly more, on net, in the past: our assumptions for changes over time are simple but unimportant.},

abstract = {Previous research [Verbrugge, Randal, 2008a. The puzzling divergence of aggregate rents and user costs, 1980–2004. The Review of Income and Wealth 54(4), 671–699] demon- strated that housing rents and ex ante user costs diverge markedly for extended periods of time, a finding with profound implications for income and inflation measurement. But the primary data sources in that study were various indexes, based upon largely disjoint data sources, constructed using different aggregation techniques, and each subject to var- ious criticisms. This raised doubts about the quality of the comparison. The relationship between user costs and rents might well be much tighter at the micro level; after all, house prices and rents (and their growth rates) can vary dramatically within cities, and rents are notoriously sticky. Furthermore, the use of indexes precludes both cross-sectional and dol- lar cost comparisons. In this study, we use Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey (CE) data to examine the relationship between user costs and rents at the individual unit-level, in dollars, using unit-level information on house value, rent, taxes, and the like. This allows us to accurately estimate unit-specific user costs and to control for unobservables like structure and neighborhood quality. We also make the point that in theory, after-tax user costs should equal net rent, i.e., expected rental income, rather than gross rent. Our findings are striking. In keeping with most previous research, we find tremendous divergence between conventional measures of user costs and net rents, thus ruling out index construction errors as a possible explanation. This divergence does not result from a faulty rent measure: we find that reported rents are sensible, in that they move similarly to official rent indexes, and are not simply out-of-pocket expenses. Instead, and most per- plexing, we find a surprisingly close correspondence between net rents and a particular estimate of user costs, one implicitly assuming zero transactions costs and constructed using an appreciation measure that is both theoretically suspect and empirically a poor predictor of actual appreciation.},

This paper does not actually examine price to rent ratios, however, they do provide a bit of background on why aggregated and index-type calculations of rent may be biased.  Most notably, and mentioned by others, is the fact that this precludes comparison of like to like dwellings as different dwellings rent and sell.  Also mentioned is the fact that index creation methods vary and that both rental and sales market have very fine scale spatial heterogeneity; a fact missed by most indexes and aggregate statistics.

 What is the value of the service flow obtained from owned housing? 
In standard frictionless Jorgensonian capital theory with competitive markets, a durable good’s rental cost will equal its ex ante user cost, suggesting that these alternative measurements of the value of the flow of services should be roughly equivalent. 
First, the use of indexes precludes a comparison in dollars, and precludes a cross-sectional comparison. Second, the use of these particular indexes precludes a comparison of like with like; for example, only about one-quarter of the BLS rent sample consists of detached housing (reflecting the rental housing stock), yet – reflecting the owned housing stock – the vast majority of the Freddie Mac and Census samples consists of detached housing. 
Third, these indexes are constructed in different ways, using different weights and index forms. It is well-known that rents and house prices have a very strong micro-spatial dimension (see, e.g., Hwang and Quigley, in press), and the same is true of house-price and rent inflation (see, e.g., Poole and Verbrugge, in press). 
Finally, each of the aforementioned indexes has been subject to its own set of criticisms; for example, there is no extant US aggregate house price index which is built using a truly representative sample, and the utilities adjustment in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Owners’ Equivalent Rent (OER) index has been criticized (see Verbrugge, 2008b).},

ANNOTATION 
  
Not a paper focused on price to rent ratio itself, but the authors do give considerable space to discussing why and how owned and rented properties are different and what this means for most equilibrium or arbitrage type models and theories.  In short, they argue that owner occupied housing and rental occupied housing are essentially two different types of housing (different markets), one a higher level than the other.  Additionally, as incomes rise so too does demand for higher quality (owner occupied) housing.  This may be driving a wedge between prices and rents.  
  
They do offer some acknowledgment of the importance of space (inner city vs suburbs) in this paper, which is a refreshing departure from much of the economics literature.  They do, however, still think in a pre-big data world, which is acceptable given this is 2008.  For example, I disagree that using the matching method is not available for large statistical model across the country.  Zillow offers this possibility.  


NOTES

We conclude that housing cannot be understood with a narrowly financial approach that ignores space any more than it can be understood with a narrowly spatial approach that ignores asset markets. 
  
If we know the owner’s income tax bracket and ability to itemize deductions, the fraction of leverage on the home, the mortgage interest rate, maintenance and depreciation expenses, the risk premium associated with housing, and expected housing price growth, then we can compare price and rents to determine whether house prices are “too high.” Recent research in this vein includes Smith and Smith (2004), McCarthy and Peach (2004), and Himmelberg, Mayer and Sinai (2005).

Contrasting the user cost of owning to rents also implicitly assumes the direct comparability of owned units to rental units and of owners to renters. However, Section IV documents that rental units tend to be very different from owner-occupied units and that owners are different from owners in economically meaningful ways.

In addition, rental and owner-occupied units also often are sited in different parts of the metropolitan area. Rental units tend to be closer to the urban core and are more likely to be in less attractive neighborhoods (as evaluated by residents surveyed in the AHS). These spatial differences may impact both the predicted level of prices and the expected level of future price appreciation.

Some researchers such as Smith and Smith (2006) have made truly heroic efforts to ensure their rental and owner-occupied properties are comparable, but this is not feasible for large scale statistical work that involves all the key markets in the country. 

Data from the most recent AHS also shows that the median income of owner households is twice that of renter households. Other sources indicate that income volatility is much greater for owners in general and for recent home buyers in particular. All this suggests that there are related, but not precisely comparable, demand schedules for owning and renting, which further implies that rents and prices need not be all that highly correlated over time.

This ratio can then be used to predict housing values if rents, true maintenance and depreciation, interest rates, property tax rates, marginal income tax rates, and expected capital gains are known, and if unobserved influences on user costs are small in magnitude.

Not only is the owner-occupied versus rental stock physically quite different, the two types of housing tend to be located in different parts of the metropolitan area, as well as in different quality neighborhoods. The suburban dominance of owner-occupancy is highlighted in the second row of Table 1. Less than one-third of all owned units were in the central cities of metropolitan areas according to the 2005 AHS. Ownership has become more widespread in America’s central cities, but nearly half of all rental units still are located in cities (row 2, column 2 of Table 1). Owner-occupied units tend to be in better neighborhoods, too. The AHS asks its survey responders to rate their neighborhoods on a scale of 1-10. Just looking at those who gave their neighborhoods very high scores of 9 or 10 score shows that almost one-half of owners believe they live in the highest quality areas, while only one-third of renters felt the same way (row 3, Table 1).

This leads us to conclude that the house price and rent series can be understood as the costs of two different types of housing. The differences seem so large that it probably is best to think of them as reflecting different demands for two related, but not directly comparable, markets

This means that owner-occupiers should be – a willing to pay about 45 percent more for the same house than should a landlord (25/17.5 {\~{}}1.45). One way of interpreting this is that if we think that price-to-rent ratio eliminates arbitrage between renting and owning, then housing is nearly 50 percent too expensive to eliminate the arbitrage between being a landlord and other forms of investment. This gap increases in higher appreciation or inflation environments because the tax subsidy to owner occupiers rises with inflation (Poterba, 1984).},

This simple piece looks at the recent increase in US housing price to assess the likelihood of a bubble.  Using simple metric such as price-to-rent and debt-to-income, they note that the recent rise is backed more solidly by fundamentals than the 2006 bubble.  In terms of PRR, nothing interesting is done here.  In fact, they don't even really talk about the method of construction at all, though in looking at data sources it appears to be a simple median method done by comparing Corelogic house price trends (probably the index) to the BLS's rent index. 
  
Notes 
The prior episode can be described as a credit-fueled bubble in which housing  valuation—as measured by the house price-to-rent ratio—and household leverage—as measured by the mortgage debt-to-income ratio—rose together in a self-reinforcing feedback loop. 
  
The price-to-rent ratio for housing is a valuation measure that is analogous to the price-to-dividend ratio for stocks. Valuation ratios are useful for gauging whether an asset price appears excessive relative to its underlying fundamental value. The fundamental value is typically measured by the present value of expected future cash or service flows accruing to the owner. 
  
Service flows from housing are called imputed rents. Higher valuation ratios imply that stock investors or homebuyers are willing to pay more for each dollar of dividends or imputed rent than they have in the past. 
  
As house prices have recovered since 2011, so too has rent growth, providing some fundamental justification for the upward price movement.},

abstract = {This paper argues that econometric analysis of housing price indexes before 2006 generated forecasts of future long-term price growth and low estimated probabilities of extreme price decreases. These forecasts of future increases in home-loan collateral values may have affected both the demand and the supply of mortgages. Standard time series models using repeat-sales indexes suggest that positive trends had a long half-life. Expectations based on such models could lead to an asset bubble. Analysis of data from the HMDA loan database and LoanPerformance.com at the MSA level and at the loan level substantiates the effects of past price trends on the demand and supply of subprime mortgages. On the demand side, at the MSA level, past home price increases are associated with more subprime applications, higher loan to income ratios and lower loan to value ratios of applications for both prime and subprime mortgages. This is consistent with the notion that households not only borrowed more but also invested more in home equity conditional on greater past house price increases. On the supply side, past home price appreciation had a significantly greater impact on the approval rate of subprime applications than the approval rate of prime applications. Loan level analysis indicates that past home price appreciation increased the approval rate of subprime applications but did not affect the approval rate of prime applications. Further, approved HMDA subprime loans had higher loan to income ratios in MSAs with greater past house price trends.},

PRR not a significant determinant of mortgage supply 

ANNOTATION 
Not really a PRR article.  Here the authors look to explain mortgage supply (prime and sub-prime) prior to, during and after the housing bust in the US.  Throughout all of their models, they find that price to rent ratio is not one of the statistically significant determinants of a variety of mortgage supply metrics during this period. 
More generally, there is much discussion about the housing bubble and its potential causes in this paper.  Not much of interest here really, with the exception of the realization that the benefits of mortgaged home ownership is increasing in income (due to marginal tax rates).  
NOTES 
Economists at the time interpreted this increase variously as a classic housing bubble, the results of home-owner money illusion, or evidence of binding supply constraints in key housing markets. 
First, expectations of positive future home price growth based on past trends render housing a more attractive asset, and suggest that a household should increase allocation to housing over the near term.  Second, because the after-tax financial benefits of mortgaged home ownership are increasing in income, higher forecast returns may also bring more low-income loan applicants into the market, which we call the participation effect. 
Overall, the results indicate that in MSAs with greater past home price growth, the demand for prime and subprime mortgages was higher and the applicant pool was riskier due to the higher loan to income ratio. 
Overall, our empirical evidence suggests that both subprime borrowers and lenders considered past housing returns as a factor in the home purchase process and the underwriting process – perhaps extrapolating the recent past as a forecast of future home values. 
One problem with relying on housing indexes as evidence of market values is that they are conditioned upon market liquidity. Crashes only appear to develop slowly in house price indexes because transactions decrease as buyers are unwilling to recognize a loss. 
Nominal monthly Case-Shiller indexes for twenty of the major metropolitan areas in the United States are available for download at the S{\&}amp;P website. Quarterly nominal indexes for all MSAs in the United States, and for each state, are available from the OFHEO website. The major difference between these two sources is the underlying data. The OFHEO data is constructed from transactions or appraisals associated with mortgages purchased or insured by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac since 1975. These mortgages are overwhelmingly prime loans, and thus by definition not subprime. 
However, for purposes of risk assessment, high correlation across markets should be grounds for greater caution, not greater comfort. It simply means that the historical data is insufficient to provide a reliable test of model validity. 
Consider the Keys et al. (2008) explanation for the volume of subprime issuance: that loan originators did not care about the quality of the loans because there was a ready market to securitize them.},

We test whether consumer behavior leads to potentially unstable market conditions with price bubbles. Our results suggest that appreciation expectations are based on past price appreciation but at the same time they depend on the fundamental factors such as, locational and structural. These findings show a hybrid consumer behavior of rational and adaptive expectations. Finally, we show how these expectations could sometimes lead to unstable price levels.},

The goal of this paper is to look at the role that price expectations play in actual housing appreciation and other housing market behaviors.

Rents for sold properties (and vice versa) and impute by the other with regression models, allowing for property-level price to rent ratio creation.  As the authors not, this help accounts for differences between sold and rented units.  

NOTES:

The relationship between house price and rent is an important concept in the analysis of housing markets.

Using rents and prices without accounting for quality differences among houses is problematic and may lead to biased results. Failing to control for different types of houses poses a problem. Previous research has provided ambiguous results which may have been caused by comparing prices of single family houses with rents, where the latter is dominated by apartments. Finally, comparing house prices and rents across different cities poses a potential problem in making inferences about the model. 

The user cost of the asset is defined originally by Jorgenson (1963), which is the sum of the after-tax opportunity cost of holding the capital asset, property taxes, and depreciation and repair, minus the expected capital gain of the asset. Poterba (1984) uses this model to argue that inflation reduces the effective cost of homeownership and raises the tax subsidy to owner occupation. He explains how changes in the expected inflation rate affect the real price of houses and the equilibrium size of housing capital stock. Himmelberg et al. (2005) uses the static version of the model to study rent-to-price ratios in housing markets. 
Capozza and Seguin (1996) address the issue of informational efficiency in the housing market. They use disaggregated data to analyze decadal appreciation rates and predict the appreciation rates for housing successfully only when they control the cross sectional differences in the quality of rental versus owner occupied housing. Other interpretations lead to conclusions of inefficiencies in the housing market.


Even with micro transaction data, when a home is for sale, the rental price for that home is not available; conversely, when a home is for rent, the house price for that home is not available. This presents a potential problem when deriving the rent-to-price ratio to test the model. 
This leads to a need to reconcile the data by matching them more exactly. Therefore, we match the rents and prices to the same house using the hedonic price method in the first micro dataset. 
The fundamental factors are locational and structural housing characteristics. These characteristics are predictors of future expectations and thus are part of future expectations that is predictable


Due to differences in the quality of rental versus owner occupied housing, appreciation rates and rent-to-price ratios calculated from aggregated data are measured with considerable error. 

Even with micro transaction data, when a home is for sale, the rental price for that home is not available; conversely, when a home is for rent, the house price for that home is not available. This presents a potential problem when deriving the rent- to-price ratio to test the model. Previous studies do not reach a consensus and significant results due to two reasons. First, most of the studies fail to adjust for quality differences. Homes with different structural characteristics, such as the size of the home, are compared with each other. Calculating appreciation rates and rent-to- price ratios in this way creates an ambiguity. Since owned and rental units tend to be of different quality, there is a measurement error in the data used by previous authors on the rent-to-price ratio.

This leads to a need to reconcile the data by matching them more exactly. Therefore, we match the rents and prices to the same house using the hedonic price method in the first micro dataset.

These datasets enable us to address the problems encountered in the previous literature such as the lack of adjustment for quality differences, the connection between prices and rents for the different type of housing, and the spatial distribution of housing. By solving these problems, the model can be tested fully and adequately to give insight on whether the implied behavioral results regarding the formation of expectations hold which in turn suggest stability.},

ANNOTATION 
The authors set out to test for dis-equilibrium by comparing price to rent ratios to an equilibrium price to rent ratio as developed with a user cost model.  On the way, they present a good discussion of and methodology for developing unbiased PRR estimates. Their model using an imputation regression approach, whereby direct matches as used to correct for any remaining biases attributable to variables omitted in the imputation regressions.  They do find that yields (the reciprocal of PRR) are highest in matched pairs, then imputed regression and finally in median or index type methods.  Further, they find that the bias between the methods changes over time{\ldots}but they don’t go as far as to attribute this to a hot or cold market.  Findings also indicate lower yields for high end properties, as expected by theory.  
Overall, a very well designed approach and execution.  Their adjustment for omitted variables is particularly interesting and serves as another approach to directly relying on matched pairs.  It would be interesting to see what property specific characteristics explain the differences between direct matches and imputed figures.  Also interesting in that their imputed PRR uses both imputed prices and imputed rents, even though one of the two is always known.  These will be important sensitivity tests to do in our modeling exercises. 

NOTES:

We also explore ways of imputing the expected capital gain – a key input into the equilibrium price–rent ratio formula, and show that price–rent ratios (both actual and equilibrium) vary in systematic ways over the housing distribution. This latter result implies that it is not enough to simply focus on the median, as different results may pertain for other quantiles. 
Departures from equilibrium therefore can be detected by comparing actual price–rent ratios with the price–rent ratio derived from the user-cost equilibrium condition. 
  
Many applications of the user-cost equilibrium condition focus on changes in the price–rent ratio rather than its level. This is because price and rent indexes are easier to obtain than actual prices and rents measured in dollars. 
Second, as noted in the final sentence of this quote, using price and rent indexes it is not possible to answer the most fundamental questions which are: (i) whether the price–rent ratio is above or below its equilibrium level and (ii) whether the price–rent ratio is moving towards or away from equilibrium 
Using a data set consisting of 730,000 price and rent observations for Sydney, Australia over the period 2001 to 2009, we find the difference is on average 18{\%}. 
It follows therefore that there is no simple rule of thumb that can be used to revise downward the actual price–rent ratio, and that the bias distorts changes over time in the quality-adjusted price–rent ratio as well as its level. 
While it can be imputed from the past performance of the housing market, we find that the resulting equilibrium price–rent ratio depends critically on the time horizon over which past performance is measured. In particular, when the time horizon is too short the equilibrium price–rent ratio is prone to become volatile and to rise in booms and fall in busts, both of which effects are liable to undermine the method's ability to detect departures from equilibrium. 
A second problem with the equilibrium price–rent ratio is that different conditions may apply in different segments of the market. For example, the depreciation rate may be lower at the high end (where the share of land in the total value of a dwelling tends to be higher). 
Our methodology and results also have applications that extend beyond the main issues addressed here. For example, failure to account for
the quality difference between owner-occupied and rented dwellings and cross-section variation in the price–rent ratio may result in the flow of housing services in national accounts (and hence GDP) being mismeasured. 
Other papers that use hedonic methods to impute rents for sold dwellings include Ar{\'{e}}valo and Ruiz-Castillo (2006), Kurz and Hoffmann (2009), Crone, Nakamura and Voith (2009) and Davis, Lehnert and Martin (2008). 
As robustness checks, we also considered alternative ways of estimating price–rent ratios, including by single imputation (i.e., where only the rent is imputed in (11) and only the price is imputed in (12)), and using a linear hedonic model instead of semilog. These changes have only a small impact on our estimated median price–rent ratios and do not change the general thrust of our results in Section 5. 
For example, if the hedonic price model includes dwellings in a particular postcode, then the rental model must include dwellings rented in the same postcode. 
Also, owner occupiers are owner-occupied dwellings are better maintained than rented dwellings (see Shilling, Sirmans and Dombrow, 1991). 
As a robustness check though we also estimate address-matched price–rent ratios using the price and rent indexes obtained from the hedonic imputation method.
The two approaches generate similar price–rent ratios. 
It is noticeable that the magnitude of the quality bias falls towards the end of our sample. This pattern can be seen clearly in Table 6 and
Fig. 1 (as the three curves converge in 2008 and 2009). This seems to be due to a fall in the average quality of dwellings sold after the boom
ends in 2004, perhaps due to an increase in the number of distressed sales. Focusing on location as a measure of quality, we find that relatively more houses were sold in cheaper postcodes in the latter part of our sample than in the earlier part. 
Taking the latter first, the owner of an expensive dwelling may wish to rent to someone reliable who will maintain the property properly.
The rent is therefore offered at a discount (see Diewert, 2009). Bracke (2015) provides evidence that the duration of tenancies tends to be longer at the high-end of the market, which is consistent with this hypothesis. Second, some lower income households may prefer to buy than
rent, but cannot get a large enough mortgage to do so. This will cause rental yield to be higher than per dollar user cost at the low end of the
market (see Duca, Muellbauer and Murphy, 2011). As is explained later, these first two explanations have implications for the measurement of GDP. 
Bracke (2015) suggests a different reason why the depreciation rate may be higher at the lower end of the market. This is that the utilization rate is higher at the low-end of  the market (i.e., the density of people for a given floor space is higher). 
Finally, while the expansion of the subprime mortgage market in the US and other countries in the decade leading up to 2008 may have
allowed more low income households to enter the housing market, these households have typically faced a higher cost of borrowing (see
for example Chomsisengphet and Pennington-Cross, 2006). In other words, low income households may face a higher interest rate r 
First, the actual price–rent ratio needs to be quality adjusted. This can be done using hedonic methods that impute prices for rented dwellings and impute rents for sold dwellings. We correct for omitted variables bias using a subsample of dwellings that both sell and rent during our sample period.},

ANNOTATION: 
Interesting article after eleven years of hindsight.  The authors look through the evidence and conclude in 2004 that housing in the US is not overvalued, though they do leave room for declines if fundamentals change.  In other words, they feel that houses were not overpriced based on fundamentals. 
One such fundamental was the price to rent ratio.  They suggested that based on PRRs housing was not overpriced, with the large condition that appreciation rates, taxes and land leverage (the relatively value of depreciation) are all local phenomenon which mean that when comparing PRR to user costs, one needs to consider local factors (which they do not).  From a methods standpoint, they use tradition median type methods, but do acknowledge that differences between houses that sell and those that rent may case biasing issues in the PRR metric. 

NOTES:

The “dividend” portion of the return from owning a house comes from the rent the owner saves by living in the house rent-free and the capital gain comes from house price appreciation over time.

Third, differences in expected appreciation rates and taxes can lead to considerable variability in the price-to-rent ratio across markets.

The growth in price-to-rent ratios—especially in cities where this ratio was already high—can be explained by the fact that house prices are more sensitive to real long-term interest rates when interest rates are already low and even more sensitive in cities where house price growth is typically high.

A second commonly cited measure used to assess housing valuations is the house price-to-rent ratio, which is akin to a price-to-earnings multiple for stocks. This metric is intended to reflect the relative cost of owning versus renting. Intuitively, when house prices are too high relative to rents, potential homebuyers will choose instead to rent, thus reducing the demand for houses and bringing house prices back into line with rents. A common argument is that when price-to-rent ratios remain high for a prolonged period, it must be that prices are being sustained by unrealistic expectations of future price gains rather than the fundamental rental value and hence contain a “bubble.”

Comparing price-to-rent ratios over time without considering changes in user costs is obviously misleading.

The long-run growth of house prices in excess of construction costs suggests that the underlying land is appreciating faster than the structures. This finding is consistent with classic theories of urban development in which the growth of cities is accompanied by (or driven by) benefits of increasing density and agglomeration. Since the supply of land near urban centers (either a city center or suburban subcenters) is in short supply, the demand for housing generated by such economic growth is capitalized into land prices.

A related finding is that price-to-rent differences across cities are persistent over time: cities with high price-to-rent ratios tend to remain high, and those with low price-to-rent ratios remain low. This fact is predicted by the user cost theory if purchasers in these “superstar” markets are correctly anticipating sustained future appreciation, because buyers in superstar cities should be willing to pay more for a house if they expect rents to rise in the future. Indeed, Sinai and Souleles (2005) find statistical evidence using data from 44 metropolitan areas that the cities with the highest price-to-rent ratios also have the highest expected growth rates of prices and rents.

Cities with higher per capita income have higher effective marginal income tax rates, which lead to higher price-to-rent ratios due to the greater value of the tax subsidy to owner-occupied housing.

Finally, it is worth noting that these computations do not account for all factors that could affect the spread in user costs between high and low appreciation rate cities. In high-priced cities, the value of structures is generally small relative to the value of the land on which they sit, which suggests that physical depreciation is small as a fraction of total property value. Lower depreciation rates (relative to value) in high land cost markets such as San Francisco and New York would lower their user costs and further increase their price-to-rent ratios relative to other cities. Our calculations do not allow for this.

A second key observation is that deviations between the imputed rent and actual rent appear strongest when real interest rates were unusually high (early 1980s) or unusually low (2001–2004). A comparison of Figures 2 and 3 makes this point quite clear. Thus, the recent run-up in house prices appears to be primarily driven by fundamental economic changes.

Finally, our valuation ratios may be biased due to trends in unmeasured quality differences between owned and rented units. We have no reason to believe that the quality of owner-occupied housing has systematically declined relative to that of rental housing. If anything, the reverse is likely true due to the strong growth in home renovation expenditures. If the quality of existing single-family homes is rising, the OFHEO price index might overstate housing appreciation rates for a constant quality house.},

NOTES


First, in the context of tenure choice, as the cost of renting increases, households are more likely to choose owner-occupancy, raising the price. Second, in the context of asset pricing, rent is a dividend from owning a house, and price will be a discounted sum of future rents. If rents are correlated over time, changes in current rents imply changes in future rents, which in turn affect housing prices. Since rents are more likely to exhibit positive serial correlation, a rise in current rent implies a rise in housing prices. When rents and prices are nonstationary, it is easy to show that the rent-price ratio can predict the future growth rate of rents. 
  
Annual rents, Rt in each metropolitan area are obtained directly from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD’s) measurement of rent at the 40th percentile of the distribution, so called, “Fair Market Rents.” In addition, we also include a lagged price-rent ratio, PDt−1, to measure the expected implicit rent growth in housing.},

ANNOTATION 
  
The authors use a unique set of data from Seoul, South Korea to test for market efficiencies via a look at price to rent ratios (or dividend price ratio) over time and space.  They find market efficiency in the Seoul condominium market during the 1990 to 2002 period.  I’m a bit sceptical of the results since the actual rent to price comparison, though made at the property level, use an imputed rent from the Chonsei payment that is tied to national discount rate.  In this way, this really isn’t a true ‘direct match’ approach.  

NOTES


Most apartments are built for sale, and each unit is typically owned by an individual. The rental market for apartments is active and lively, but few apartment complexes have been built to provide permanent rental accommodation. Rather, the rental housing supply consists of units which individual owners choose to rent, customarily on a fixed two-year basis. An owner-occupied apartment can be turned into a rental unit, and vice versa, anytime without cost. Apartment complexes built specifically to provide permanent rental accommodations do not exist in Korea except for a small number of apartments for families with very low incomes. 
  

Housing researchers in other countries have difficulties in constructing rent and sale price data which control for the myriad differences between rental and owner-occupied dwellings (Meese and Wallace, 1994). With data on Korean apartments, one can match the rent to the selling price of an identical unit, and indices of the rent and the sale price of apartments can be constructed from the same set of dwellings.

The Chonsei system combines two separate transactions in a single contract. The first is a loan made by the tenant to the landlord, and the second is a lease by which the landlord grants use of the residence to the tenant for imputed interest payments on the Chonsei deposit. If the landlord does not return the Chonsei deposit at the end of the rental term, the tenant can sue for a foreclosure sale to recover the deposit. 
  
But these latter studies are typically based on evidence from North America, where housing and housing markets are quite heterogeneous and where detailed observations on rents and selling prices for the same dwellings are not available.
   
Movements of Chonsei deposits roughly follow those of sale prices, with some significant differences. The asset price bubble for apartments burst in 1991, but there is no corresponding Bbulge{\^{}} in the Chonsei trend. In the mid-1990s, sale prices remained stable, but Chonsei prices continued to rise. Also, Chonsei prices recovered much faster than sale prices after the economic crisis of the late 1990s. These differences arise because Chonsei prices reflect the market for residential services flows rather than the stocks of investment assets. Expected capital gains affect sale prices, but not Chonsei deposits. The same logic (i.e., that the real estate market tends to be more stable than other asset markets) may explain the greater stability of the trends in implicit rents.},

Price to rent ratios have not been stationary over the past thirty years.  The authors here show that the usual present value model does not do a good job explain this non-stationarity.  Using a model that allows for a present value residual (PVR), they do confirm that the non-stationarity exists.  In other words, typical factors such as expected housing returns and rent returns do not fully explain the ratio.  Rather, as they suggest, housing policy and regional specific trends may do so. 
Additionally, they find that the PRR is more variable in areas with low supply elasticity, as measured by both Saez’s (2010) geographic measures and the Wharton Index.  Interest rates have a small impact on PRR, with lower interest rates equating to higher PRR.  Finally, they find that most of the PRR changes are driven by price movements and not by rent movements, as rents have generally kept pace with inflation. 
NOTES: 

A big portion of the housing market literature has focused on the price–rent ratio as a metric to measure the extent of overvaluation in the housing market. Most of these empirical studies have used some version of the present-value model of house prices to examine the sources of variation in the price–rent ratio and have found a mixture of results depending on which market is considered. 
The housing market version of this model implies that the current price–rent ratio reflects households׳ expectations about future rent growth and future housing returns. 
The above model suggests that the log of the price–rent ratio can be expressed as the expected discounted sum of future rent growth minus future housing returns. 
One explanation of the non-stationarity of the price–rent ratio is that there are some other factors that drive the variation in price–rent ratio and these factors are non-stationary. This is consistent with the nature of U.S. housing markets. Unlike stock markets, the functioning of the housing markets in the U.S. is characterized by illiquidity, high transaction costs, differential tax regimes, and zoning laws. To take into account these features of the housing market, we propose a modified present-value model that decomposes the price–rent ratio into the present-value of expected house price growth, the present-value of expected rent growth, and a present-value residual (PVR) component that captures non-stationary factors. 
 Recently, Fairchild et al. (2015)use a dynamic factor model in the present-value framework and estimate the relative share of national and local share in variation of the price–rent ratio. They also use data from the U.S. and 17 MSAs. They find that a large fraction of the variation is based on local factors. In their analysis, they allow for a pricing error in the present-value relationship, but their model also assumes that this pricing error is stationary in nature. In other related work, Ambrose et al. (2013) use 355 years of data for Amsterdam and find that deviations of house prices from their fundamentals are long-lasting and persistent. 
Overall, the results from the supADF test and our model seem to indicate that the MSAs that had large PVR components are the same MSAs that witnessed explosive sub-periods in their price–rent ratios, especially during the 2005–2007 subsample. 
We use quarterly data and our sample runs from 1975:Q1 through 2014:Q2. The data on house prices are from Freddie Mac. Rent data is the rent of primary residences from the BLS. Some researchers have used owner׳s equivalent rent of residences as a measure of rent, but the sample period for that series only begins in 1982. We convert the nominal rent growth and house price growth to real growth rates by deflating nominal rents and house prices by CPI of each MSAs and the nation. The quarterly data for CPI and the rent have been computed by taking the monthly averages. 
It can be clearly seen that the mean of expected real rent growth is much smaller in magnitude than the expected housing return implying that in all the MSAs and the United States, rents have grown roughly at the same rate as the overall inflation. The results suggest that the persistence parameter (AR coefficient $\delta$1) for the expected housing return is much higher than for the expected rent growth. 
 This positive correlation between the rent growth and the housing return is consistent with what other researchers have found for the stock market. For example, Bernanke and Kuttner (2005) and Campbell and Ammer (1993) found that shocks to expected dividend growth and equity premia are positively correlated. The positive correlation between expected future rent growth and housing return that we document could simply indicate that rents do not increase by “enough” during periods of rising house price growth, which mechanically implies a contemporaneous increase in housing return. 
Because we have motivated this component through the institutional, regulatory, and macroeconomic changes, one could think of the shock to this residual term as arising from some regulatory changes or through monetary policy actions which the past behavior of rent growth, housing return, and the price–rent ratio cannot predict.  
We find that most of the variation in the present-value component is explained by expected changes in the housing return. In fact, for all the MSAs as well as for the United States, the percentage of variation explained by expected rent growth is never higher than 6.5{\%}. 
This result is uniform across all of the MSAs. The magnitude of the increase and decline, however, varies across different MSAs. On the one hand, there are MSAs like Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Seattle and San Francisco where the PVR component was higher than 20{\%} during the boom. On the other hand, there are MSAs like Cleveland, Dallas, Houston, and Pittsburgh where the deviation was very small and ranged from 3 to 10{\%}. We also have MSAs like Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Portland, and St. Louis where the PVR component was somewhere in the middle. It should be noted that for some MSAs like Dallas, Houston, and San Francisco, the PVR component is almost the same or higher in 2013/2014 as compared to its corresponding value during the financial crisis. 
What our results suggest is that a big portion of the overall variation in the price–rent ratio cannot be explained by the present-value model itself.  
Because there are no time-series data on these housing supply elasticities, we exploit the cross-sectional variation in the PVR component across different MSAs. We find that the correlation between the absolute mean of the PVR component and geography based supply elasticity is −0.642, whereas the correlation between the estimated standard deviation of the shock to the PVR component and the geography based elasticity is −0.662. This implies that MSAs with inelastic housing supply based on geography are also the MSAs with price–rent ratios that have higher deviations from the present-value level. Using the regulation based measure, we find that the correlation between the absolute mean and the regulation index is 0.615, whereas this correlation is 0.652 for standard deviation of the shock to the PVR component and the regulation index. This result implies that MSAs with higher regulation index are also the MSAs that have a more volatile and higher absolute mean PVR component. Overall, our results are consistent with the strand of literature on the housing market in which researchers have found close relationship between housing supply elasticity and house price volatility. 
Likewise, Fairchild et al. (2015) find that interest rate accounts for only about 17{\%} of the variation in the aggregate log price–rent ratios. 
They consider a behavioral approach to motivate the decomposition of the price–rent ratio into a rational component and a mispricing term and show that the mispricing term is highly correlated with nominal interest rate and inflation. They attribute this behavior to ‘money illusion’.  
On the other hand, this estimate is only 0.3{\%} for Cleveland. The results presented here show that low interest rates may have played a role in the housing market boom after all, but only for those MSAs that were more sensitive to the changes in the interest rates. This result is consistent with studies that document possibly divergent sensitivities of disaggregate housing markets to a monetary-policy shock. 
Our findings suggest that the PVR term representing the deviation of the price–rent ratio from its present-value level is important both at the national and the regional levels. This is especially true for the MSAs that have experienced frequent booms and busts in the housing market.},

NOTES:

We define a bubble as a situation in which the market prices of certain assets (such as stocks or real estate) rise far above the present value of the anticipated cash flow from the asset (what Kindleberger called the asset's use or earning capacity). This definition suggests many of the features noted above: prices rising rapidly, a speculative focus on future price increases rather than the asset's cash flow, and an eventual drop in prices. However, these features are only suggestive. Market prices can rise rapidly if fundamental values are increasing rapidly or if prices are far below fundamental values. Market prices can drop (for example, in a financial crisis) even when there has been no bubble. What truly defines a bubble is that market prices are not justified by the asset's anticipated cash flow.

In the housing market, how? ever, professionals
cannot sell homes short and cannot obtain the tax
advantages available for owner-occupied
housing by physically occupying multiple homes. It is also expensive to manage and monitor rental properties, especially from afar. If a myopic focus on comps causes housing prices to depart from fundamentals, there is no immediate self-correcting mechanism.

Thus, just as with price-earnings ratios in the stock market, price-rent ratios in the housing market can rise without signaling a bubble if, for example, interest rates fall or the anticipated rate of growth of rents rises.

In addition, the dwellings included in price indexes do not match the dwellings in rent indexes, so that the resulting comparison is of apples to oranges. The ratio of a home sale price index to a rent index can rise because the prices of homes in desirable neighborhoods increased more than did the rents of apartment buildings in less desirable neighborhoods. Or perhaps the quality of the average home in the price index has increased relative to the quality of the average property in the rent index. In any case, gauging fundamental value requires actual rent and sale price data, not indexes with arbitrary scales.

Today it is still true that rental and sale properties differ, on average, in location and attributes. But, at the margin, close substitutes are generally available. It is possible to buy a small condominium or to rent a house with a large yard. It is possible
to buy or rent a small or a large house.

The only weakness in these data is if there were any special circumstances, such as a below-market
rent for someone who agreed to repaint the home, or if the home was purchased and major renovations were made before it was rented. The perfect-match data include both the same-homes data and homes that are quantitatively identical (same number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage) and virtually adjacent. The},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates that, in the context of U.S. housing data, rents and ex ante user costs diverge markedly—in both growth rates and levels—for extended periods of time, a seeming failure of arbitrage and a puzzle from the perspective of standard capital theory. The tremendous volatility of even appropriately-smoothed ex ante annual user cost measures implies that such measures are unsuitable for inclusion in official price statistics. The divergence holds not only at the aggregate level, but at the metropolitan-market level as well, and is robust across different house price and rent measures. But transactions costs matter: the large persistent divergences did not imply the presence of unexploited profit opportunities. In particular, even though detached housing is readily moved between owner and renter markets, and the detached-unit rental market is surprisingly thick, transactions costs would have prevented risk-neutral investors from earning expected profits by buying a property to rent out for a year, and would have prevented risk-neutral homeowners from earning expected profits by selling their homes and becoming renters for a year. Finally, computing implied appreciation as a residual yields a house price forecast with huge errors; but either longer-horizon or no-real-capital-gains forecasts— which turn out to have similar forecast errors—imply a far less divergent user cost measure which might ultimately be useful for official price statistics. Some conjectures are offered.},

ANNOTATION 
Verbrugge examines why user costs and rents have diverged. Interestingly, existing ex post user cost indexes are incredibly volatile, but in the case of comparison to rent they have no rationale as ex ante user costs should be used. Gaps even remain between ex ante user costs and rents and do remain over large periods of time.  One such rational here is that transaction costs keep agents from moving between being renters and buyers and as a result they are not able to be in the most economically wise situation at any given time.  Second, appreciation expectations which form a major component of ex ante user costs are very difficult to correctly forecast and actual market participants may actually factor in the probability of a bubble burst. 
Not a true price to rent ratio analysis, but one in which rent series (aggregated here) are compared against a per-period measure of housing costs (analogous though not identical to house prices).  Good background material.  
 NOTES

But in many contexts, such ex post measures of user costs are not the most interesting or relevant measure, for several reasons. First, ex post user costs can be negative. Second, decisions are made on the basis of ex ante rather than ex post user costs. Third, rents should equal ex ante rather than ex post user costs.

The large wedges offer a partial explanation of the significant divergences: rents and user costs might evolve somewhat independently until their divergence becomes large. Another way to put this is that the owner-occupied and rental markets are segmented. This possibility is explored in Verbrugge (2007b).

Furthermore, rent inflation for continuing tenants is notoriously subdued, suggesting that landlords’ planning horizons also exceed one year. In environments with significant transactions costs, neither the theory of landlord behavior, nor of user costs, is fully developed.

However, rent indexes generally do not share this temporal feature. Instead, these indexes are averages constructed from a sample of all extant rent contracts, rather than from a sample of new contracts each period.

If one assumes that all rental contracts are renewed on an annual basis (as most are), and that renewal dates (and new contract dates) are distributed uniformly across all quarters, the user-cost series can be put on the same temporal basis by replacing the current user cost with a one-sided five-quarter moving average.

As discussed in the Appendix, along both of these dimensions of comparability, neither the CPI OER indexes nor the CPI rent indexes are perfect matches to the home price indexes used. To address these data comparability issues (and to develop a rent index that is more directly comparable to the repeat-sales house price indexes), a monthly rent index using a post-1987 CPI rent microdata set comprised of rents only of single detached dwellings was constructed. The details of the construction are in the Appendix.

Seemingly small changes in interest rates or expected appreciation can have very large effects on user costs, since these often represent large percentage changes in yt. 
It is possible that inappropriate aggregation, even at the level of a city, might mask a much tighter relationship at the micro level. 
The above analysis hinges upon an assumption that expectations are formed via a forecasting approach. While there is abundant evidence in favor of this hypothesis, and while home price appreciation is extremely persistent, one might nonetheless argue that rational agents admit the possibility of rational bubbles, and hence—during periods in which bubbles are suspected—would reduce their appreciation forecast via attaching positive probability to a bubble burst. This point was made more generally by Matthew Shapiro, who noted that determining the correct measure of expected appreciation would be challenging. 
Residential real estate is typically a composite good: the structure, a depreciating capital good which delivers a flow of consumption services over a long period of time; and land, an appreciating asset.},
